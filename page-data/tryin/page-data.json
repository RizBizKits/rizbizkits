See, I’ve gotten too comfortable by staring at blank documents, transforming these into written, wanna-be poems; leaving the discovering of the subject in the act of writing, itself. “This doesn’t work with prose”, I hear the outspoken, inner-voice of Rizwana The Self-Critic.  </p>\n<p>“..you gotta know what you wanna write about first, dummy”, it says without much a presence of any manners.  </p>\n<p>I am reminded of a time I set out to write ‘quotes’. As a kid, I would read all these amazing words  (having searched for, for e.g., “Quotes on Time” , “ Quotes on Home” etc.), and think these were written by Quote Writers. Great authors who sat down perfecting their craft into quote-sized writings. A genre unlike any other!  </p>\n<p>Rizwana The Self-Critic was cool with it/back then.  </p>\n<p>Frankly, it was running into a blog post in which Someone Wonderful advised writing more blog posts that jolted my brain into doing this. Someone Wonderful writes words that are wonderful.  </p>\n<p>Of course, I wanted to be able to do the same.  </p>\n<p>Only how do I say things, clearly?  </p>\n<p>I began this sentence comparing Clarity to chasing after the horizon. You understand why I had to erase that sentence. I can’t even describe Clarity without muddling it up with an elaborate picture of the horizon in a county with palm trees. Is this what you were promised, Reader?  </p>\n<p>Is this the kind of empty blog posts you had advised, Someone Wonderful?  </p>\n<p>Why are there so many questions?  </p>\n<p>This fills just about half of my blank document. My brain at this point regrets this, entirely. Rizwana The Self-Critic consoles me, certain no one will read this. More surely so, if I bin this.  </p>\n<p>I am reminded of a time in the future I might look back to this (maybe, Clarity, then, would be as simple as a giggle).  </p>\n<p>Every so often, prose is the passerby in close quarters.  </p>\n<p>I’m sorry, brain, I tried. I really did.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 24, 2019","path":"/tryin","title":"tryin'"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
