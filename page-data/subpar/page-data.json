Laying letters into a semblance of a blog post. I’ve ran into the act of writing something, anything, yet again…for good reason. A word of caution: This, I type past midnight on a Friday and while I’m not particularly sleepy, the editor-in-me is more forgiving of subpar writing around this time.  </p>\n<p>It’s been a week since Final Year of Uni began. As ridiculous as me worrying over the stress of deadlines sounds (hell, it’s a sign of my privilege that I get to rant on this particular #1stWorldProblem ), it’s rather difficult to un-worry? I ought to accept this as the norm. After all, we’re all drifting under different weights of worry at different times, whether or not we lay it out into words. That’s a shared comfort in any turmoil.  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Yesterday was #NationalPoetryDay and oh boy, how I loved it. Poetry’s slipped into my life and taken hold of so much of how these thoughts, untangle. And, its continued to remain a novel medium of self-expression after all this time. I’m still sure I don’t do it right. See, I’ve never had someone teach it to me. Thus, I admit to calling myself a poet on material that may be as far away from poetry as the North and South poles, themselves.  </p>\n<p>Even then, I chase its company.  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>To mark the occasion yesterday, I spammed the whole of Twitter with a million poetry-related tweets and likes and retweets. Here, I’ll share a duality with these 2 incredible poems.  </p>\n<ol>\n<li>Maggie Smith’s <em>Good Bones</em><br>\n<img src=\"/blog/good-bones.jpeg\" alt=\"Maggie Smith’s Good Bones\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 40px; display: block; max-width: 100%;\" /></li>\n<li>Danusha Lameris’s <em>Small Kindnesses</em><br>\n<img src=\"/blog/small-kindnesses.jpeg\" alt=\"Danusha Lameris’s Small Kindnesses\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 40px; display: block; max-width: 100%;\" />  </li>\n</ol>\n<p>Both of these poems unpacked, beautifully - a lasting feeling. I was better for having read them and I hope, maybe, even ONE of you reading them here⁠...now⁠, are, too?</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Finally, because I could not help myself:</em>  </p>\n<p><strong>Remember, if you find a poet/poet-in-making around you:</strong>  </p>\n<p><em>Welcome their words with them. Bring their meek, uncertain verses into the limelight. Ask them how troublesome their writing's been to them.</em>  </p>\n<p><em>They'll shuffle their feet &#x26; thank you in their heart, quietly.</em>  </p>\n<hr>\n<p>Until next time.  </p>\n<p>-2:23AM</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"October 04, 2019","path":"/subpar","title":"Subpar"}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false}}}
