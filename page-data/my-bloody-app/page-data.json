Whilst I had intended to get this written and published much earlier, I appreciate us right now; you, reading <em>this</em>, and I, <em>well</em>, having written it. Forgive this anticlimactic introduction to all of this, I anticipate I will learn to avoid waffling in these passages; someday.  </p>\n<p>There‚Äôs good news. If you‚Äôve listened to my previous <a href=\"https://rizwanakhan.com/rizamblings/ep7\">podcast episode</a>  üëÄ, you know I was struggling with coming up for an idea for a Final Year project for my Uni (studying Comp Sci @ NTU). Well, I‚Äôve welcomed an idea into the confines of my brain, and this has become <em>The Chosen One</em>, officially.  </p>\n<p><em><h3 class=\"text-stylize\">‚ÄúAnd for What, For What..</h3></em></p>\n<img src=\"/blog/BA-problem.png\" alt=\"Palm Trees\" style=\"margin: 0px 0 40px; display: block; max-width: 100%;\" /> \n<p><strong>Allow me to explain.</strong></p>\n<p>In 2016, the NHS reports that <strong>‚Äòhalf of all blood donors are over 45 years old‚Äô</strong> despite <strong>‚Äò400 new donors [needed] a day to meet demand‚Äô</strong>. What‚Äôs further worrying is a newer statistic from 2018: <strong>‚Äòa staggering 81 percent of 18-24 year olds have never donated blood‚Äô</strong>.</p>\n<p>Now, I‚Äôll be honest. <strong>I'm part of that 81%</strong>. I‚Äôm 21 years old and I‚Äôve never even looked at arranging to become a donor, much less actually donated. </p>\n<p>What‚Äôs worse is my mind‚Äôs a blank when I try and ask myself <em>‚Äòwhy haven‚Äôt I?‚Äô</em>. I catch myself jumping to simple answers: <em>‚ÄòIt‚Äôs never crossed my mind‚Äô</em> or <em>‚ÄòNo one‚Äôs directly asked‚Äô</em> etc. Weak reasons for what can be summed up as indifference/lack of interest.  </p>\n<p>I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs others like me?</p>\n<p><em><h3 class=\"text-stylize\">..No matter what you do it will never amount to anything..</h3></em></p>\n<p>Thus, here's what I know: I've identifed a very real problem to work on, for the next 6 months on this final year project. Actually, let me correct that: <strong>I've become aware of this very real problem.</strong> It was on a double-decker bus to University that I read these stats on the NHS Give Blood website. Perhaps it was four or five stops before mine. Regardless, I'm convinced I was in some level of shock at those numbers.  </p>\n<p>To tell you how I look to solve this? I'm...not sure. I am aiming towards a mobile-first web application (prefreabbly a Progressive Web App). Something that looks into the kind of 'hooks' that gets the youth wanting to donate blood once and then again....AND tell their friends about it.  </p>\n<p>Thereby, emulating the apps and/or techniques used by companies that you'd find on a majority of phones belonging to that younger age group; What keeps you using Spotify? Why do you find Instagram Stories so engaging? And why do you keep refreshing your feed? </p>\n<p>Perhaps there's lessons to be learnt and tricks to be utilised from these modern apps that have ingrained so deeply into our daily routine.</p>\n<p>Sure, the solutions are rough around the edges right now. Typing this in October, who knows what breakthroughs/difficulties Riz-in-April has hit in time for final submission.\nMore so, as a designer who codes or a coder who designs, this solo endeavour is both exciting and terrifying...times two. </p>\n<img src=\"/blog/BA-solution.png\" alt=\"Palm Trees\" style=\"margin: 40px 0 40px; display: block; max-width: 100%;\" />  \n<p><em><h3 class=\"text-stylize\">..but a single drop in a limitless ocean.</h3></em>  </p>\n<p>What I intended for <strong>this</strong> blog post to become was merely the first of all the prelimary steps before taking that Step One.  </p>\n<p><em>'Why?'</em>, you may ask. Here's why, perhaps.</p>\n<p>Someone motivated me last week to <strong>keep asking questions</strong>. Another Someone has inspired me with their long-standing, exemplary <strong>habit of self-documentation</strong>.  </p>\n<p>What I'm trying to get across to you is the simple fact that sharing my bucket of a brain with the smarter collective mind is how I've learnt best, what's kept me inspired...and I wish I had a more eloquent method of expressing that sentiment.  </p>\n<p><em><h3 class=\"text-stylize last\">..What is an ocean but a multitude of drops.‚Äù</h3></em>\n<span class=\"ba-author\">‚Äï David Mitchell, Cloud Atlas</span></p>\n<p>How it all goes down from here is beyond anyone's guess. 2 weeks into Uni, the stakes are rising.
